    "Here we made our main class inherit from ShowBase. This class loads most of the other Panda3D modules, and causes the 3D window to appear. The run() method contains the Panda3D main loop. It renders a frame, handles the background tasks, and then repeats. It does not normally return, so it needs to be called only once and must be the last line in your script. In this particular example, there will be nothing to render, so you should expect a window containing an empty grey area."

    "Panda3D contains a data structure called the Scene Graph. The Scene Graph is a tree containing all objects that need to be rendered. At the root of the tree is an object named render. Nothing is rendered until it is first inserted into the Scene Graph.\n",

    "To install the grassy scenery model into the Scene Graph, we use the method reparentTo(). This sets the parent of the model, thereby giving it a place in the Scene Graph. Doing so makes the model visible in the scene.\n",

    "Panda3D uses the “geographical” coordinate system where position (-8, 42, 0) means map coordinates (8, 42) and height 0. If you are used to OpenGL/Direct3D coordinates, then hold up your right hand in the classical position with thumb as X, fingers as Y, and palm as Z facing toward you; then tilt backward until your hand is level with the fingers pointing away and palm facing up. Moving “forward” in Panda3D is a positive change in Y coordinate.\n",
