Apollonian Basket:

The maths behind the Apollonian Basket:

The curvature/bend of a circle is defined to be the reciprocal of its radius.
- Negative curvature indicates that all other circles are internally tangent to that circle (inside the circle so it only applies to the first outer circle, in which we will plot all the other circles)
- A zero curvature gives a line (circle with infinite radius)
- Positive curvature indicates that all other circles are externally tangent to that circle. This circle is in the interior of circle with negative curvature.


Parameters:
- theta: angle
- starting radius

Initial conditions:
- the outer circle has radius -1.
- the apollonian gasket requires three predetermined circles.
